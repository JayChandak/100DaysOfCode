We use two pointers, one starting from the beginning of the string (start) and the other from the end of the string (end).
While the start pointer is less than the end pointer, we compare characters at these positions.
We ignore non-alphanumeric characters, moving start pointer right or end pointer left if encountered.
If the characters at start and end positions are not equal, the string is not a palindrome, and we return false.
If all characters match, the string is a palindrome, and we return true.
