Problem - Balanced Binary Tree

Approach - 
Binary Tree is called Balanced, when the height of left subtree - height of right subtree is less than or equal to 1.

Using max height function to get the heights.
If the absolute difference between their heights is greater than 1, then it is not balanced tree so return -1.
